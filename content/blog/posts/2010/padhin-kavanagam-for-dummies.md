Padhin Kavanagam is the art of doing 10 different things SIMULTANEOUSLY, as told by my Tamil teacher in the 8th Grade. 'Dasavadhani'  is the _Vada Naattu_ name to denote a person who is capable of the same. Ever since i heard that, i thought to myself these are all highly overrated concepts and not at all possible at least in our world. Let alone Munis and Rishis and all heavenly figures in sexy clothing. I was pretty sure these are all to-be-extinct tamil words.

All these thought until i saw it with my own eyes. That too in Chennai, in the ever crowded Mount Road. He did not look like a saint. He did not have big beards. He did not have _thandai_ and _kamandalam._ He did have a _latti_ and _thoppi_. He didn't wear Kaavi, he sported _Kaakhi._ No prizes for guessing. It's the traffic police inspector. Here's Padhinkavanagam explained with examples for Dummies' sake.

1\. Keeping an eye for a Potentially _Mamooling_ Vehicle. Yamaha R15 or Royal Enfield Thunderbird driven by 19 year old guys with French beards and Liverpool jerseys are like marinated chicken pieces ready to be fried. Always on the look out for easy cash.

2\. Blocking the already _madakkufied_ vehicle in such a way that he doesn't take off without paying the 'fine'. Mostly involves the easy way - removing the vehicle key or sometimes the hard way - standing right in front of the vehicle with one leg on the front tyre. All those months of training in the Training Academy pays off now.

3\. Checking the Driving License of the _Madakkufyee ._ No need to get into details like seeing whether the face matches, doubts about whether he was fully dressed while the PP photo was taken and all. Coz, it was one of them who granted those wonderful licenses. _Paambin Kaal Paambariyum._

4\. There is no big scope in Licenses nowadays. But big booty lies in the Vehicle insurance section. A quick check whether the date of the insurance has expired always ensures that there'll be no regrets afterwards.

5\. Nobody just surrenders without a fight or a pleading. Ranging from _'Sir engappa yaaru theriyuma'_ to _'Sir intha thadava vitrunga sir. Please office kku time aachu'_ and even to _'Inthaanga engappa line la irukkaru, pesunga'_ . So gotta be ready to talk out and take out cash  in any of these situations. One of my all time favorite small talk from a Traffic Policeman is _'Ithellam enga pocketukku illa. Governmentkku. Paaru Billellam podren. Correct a amount kooda ezhutharen paaru'._ Bill booka print panrathe ivanga thaan. Hmph.

6\. While the talk is going on, billing goes on parallely. _"Deenadayalan , 200 rooba , overspeed. Intha pa . Inga oru kayezhuthu podu. Inga katna 200 rooba . Courtukku pona 1000 rooba . Epdi vasathi?"_

7\. While all these things are happening, a sad lonely walkie talkie is shouting with all its might in his belt strap. It'll look like they dont seem to listen to what it says. But a subconscious part of the brain is always gathering information from the call, a chennai map materializing inside his head. If that processes any words like _"Accident, 2 wheeler, and any place which is 5 km from where he is standing"_, then he must hurry. Accidents mean big cash. And early bird gets the worm.

8\.  Checking on the Constable is another threaded process. Traffic SI or Inspectors don't 'catch' cases technically. Some brave constable men run into the middle of the road, scare the guy on the bike to death and then take him to the SI . So there is a high possibility that the constable may himself pocket some side amount. Constable check is very important as it splits valuable cash.

9\. Amount check is the important of all. _" Antha white color field marshall bike irukulla, athula petrol tank pouch la amount a vechittu poidunga. Naan kaila vaangarthe illa"_ maybe easy to say. But those intense moments when he walks to the bike and keeps the cash are too important. Afterall it was a result of a hard day's work.

10\. Standing in the roads at noon time in Chennai itself is a big achievement. So they refresh themselves by sipping onto Elaneer/Karumbu Juice/Cool Drink most of the times. The refreshments are provided free of cost by the nearby shop keepers out of their respect towards traffic police men.

This 10 item cycle goes on and on and on, till the collection for the day had reached the desired threshold value. So thinking about the fact that [CCTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_City_Traffic_Police) Inspectors are capable of super human feats, makes me feel proud. Really Proud to trod among these _Padhin Kavanaga Kaavalaalis._

Please note: The Post is intended only against corrupt traffic policemen. The remaining 2.4578 % Traffic Police can safely ignore the post.
