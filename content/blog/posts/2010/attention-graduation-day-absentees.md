This post is for all the people who had missed the Anna University Graduation day held on 26th March 2010.  Most of them who missed citing overseas journey reasons and a few of them who could have made it but chose not to.  (So people who did attend , please dont close the window. Cross check if i left something). Here's a list of things you have really missed out of the Graduation Day. All list items are in no particular order.

**1\. The Yellow Graduation Gown** - You have missed a lifetime opportunity of taking pictures sporting a Briiiight Yellow Grad Gown. The adventure of wearing it and running around the campus is nothing when compared to the big fight which happened while getting and returning it. (Cost: INR 150 of which 100 is a Safety Deposit)

**2\. The Report of the Academic Yea**r - The report was read by some unknown gentleman in the stage. Apparently nothing was told about the graduates or the no\_of\_graduates graduating this year. Was more like a Annual Budget of Unnecessary machinery bought, which is sure to get extinct in the next 5 years. The only figures on campus were the ones in this speech. Lakhs and Crores of them.

**3\. Love tips by Mr.A.Raja** - The chief guest of the evening was Mr.A.Raja Hon. Cabinet Minister for Communications and IT. The speech given was filled with quotations and citations of great leaders. Annadurai, G.B.Shaw, Ambedkar, Tholkappian, Newton all under one roof. Also had some of his own compilation on figure-chasing and kavithai-writing. The most important part was his seamless translation between English and Tamil. Major Sundarajan would have been proud if he had heard him speak.

**4\.  VC's English** - 'Aai rekquezzt all aap of you to stand ub faar inbokasion. ' said our VC when the program started. Throughout the program, there were many such astonishing sentences which he spoke to the gathering . He is indeed, fit for the job.

**5\. Oath of Supremacy** \- Before the program got over, we were asked to stand up and take a Oath . The oath mainly consisted of something that should be _kadaipidichifyed_ in order to uphold the pride of the institution. About something to be done to the society. Blah Blah. To sum it all up it was an oath which meant " I will not tell anything about CEG and the things which happen in the inside to a prospective student. I will say all nice and cool things about the college to the people at work and maintain the gethu of the institution"

But jokes apart you have really missed the sheer joy of being with friends together, of falling in love with the Campus the 1000th time over, of passing comments about the speaker when a speech is going on, of taking pictures at spots you wouldn't have looked twice during your first three years, of sitting in places in the campus where you had sat a million times before,  of the fact that eventhough you had seen the big sign at the entrance saying "Graduation Day" for four full years you had never felt proud about it till you saw it on that day, of contempt seeing that there are no new figures for the juniors to sight on, of standing up when the name of the department topper's name is read out on stage, of _samalichifying_ by saying "_Inga okkanthu koothadikkara sogam , stage poi vaangina varuma_" , of the "_Machaan"_ you hear from someone whom you last spoke to some 10 to 11 months before_,_ of pissing in the red building toilet and finding out that NOTHING has changed in the last year and your olfactory system is as clean as a whistle and finally the joy of holding a laminated A4 sheet which is the result of the 18 year long (No, PRE KG isnt a struggle) educational battle which you had fought.

P.S. I had missed out a list of takeaways which were given in the venue.

- Ribbon Murukku - 1 Packet. approx. 150 grams (Grand Sweets)
- Milk Sweet which looked a lot like Laddu - 3 Nos (Grand Sweets)
- Degree Certificate - 1 No. With your smart card photo on it which everyone WILL make fun of for sure.
