I have seen many people writing about things they overheard at the elevator . Everytime i used to think these are written just to grab attention and nothing good can be overheard from a elevator. But seriously if there is one interesting place at work , it has to be the elevator . Just a few months into I.T, i have started loving the Elevator travel . It is a place where you can hear about anything and everything . Sports , Politics, Kisu Kisu , Movie Climaxes, Evan Evala sight adikkaaran adhu ithunnu motha ulaga nadappugal ellam therinjikkalaam. But it is not technically overhearing when you do it on a elevator . In that small space whatever you speak , even in your lightest whisper can be heard by others as though they hear it from a Bose Amp .

I have noted one thing about people entering the 'lift' . They come in , take a nice look at everybody in it mostly to assess the people inside if the left were to get stuck  . Possible a head count and then either start looking at the fan or read the 'Instructions to follow incase of emergency' for the umpteenth time . Idhu oru comedy nna next comedy people speaking in phones inside lifts . Giggling girls talking as soft as they can in the phone, thinking nobody can hear. Not knowing the fact that the boyfriend on the other side is audible too. _"Saaptiya" "Illa pa, inikku work irukku" " Hmmm Apparam" ._

One more interesting group of people is a bunch of boys and a girl who get down at different floors. One boy keeps talking nonsense with the girl ignoring his sagaas along side. And antha ponnu erangi lift edutha odane avan friends avana paathu vidra look irukke . Appappa.  Other set of people are the self smilers. Get in Lift -> Take Mobile Phone -> Check Message -> Smile.

Finally the languages that you hear in a lift . Tamil , Telugu , Kannada, Hindi , Economic Times English, I am one grade higher than you English, Boy Girl English , Girl Girl english and most important TANGLISH

"Indian English is a recognized form of English"  said one of my soft skills faculty in a training session . I thought she was exaggerating the fact . But Wiki has a biiig article on Indian English . Eventhough Indian English has attained global popularity i must say Tamilian English has a class of its own. Ippo edhukku idha solrennu paakkareengala .  Wait, I "Overheard" a conv at the elevator today .

Girl: You are coming to the canteen no ?

Boy :Illa Illa. my Lead you know no . Athaan, Hema Parthasarathy . Semma strictu . 5 mins i come late , she makes me sit half hour extra in evening.

Girl: Oh, actually my lead was like that only . Now she is not like that . What to say...Kind of lenient .

Boy: Really? Lucky Yaar. You are staying in OMR only ?

Girl: Ya Ya. Behind that Varasakthi Vinaayagar temple.

Boy: Oh okay . My floor came . Well meet in the evening Okaya?

Lifts can be places of potential information exchange and fun . So next time you go in a lift , don't forget to overhear :D
