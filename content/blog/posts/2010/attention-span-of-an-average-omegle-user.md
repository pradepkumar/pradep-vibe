I've been [hearing](http://www.google.com/buzz/majinrage/DZMJ7S4YVcK/just-checked-out-chatROulette-which-has-only-boys) quite a lot about [chatroulette](http://www.chatroulette.com/) now from my friends. I went to it's wiki page to find out whether it was really developed by a 17 year old. And yes it was. But what interested me was a link in the Similar Pages in chatroulette wiki, called [Omegle](http://omegle.com/). It said it was just like chatroulette without the video and audio. Anyways i thought there is so much buzz about reviewing the [kinds of people](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kz4ju6WY6u1qz4bp6o1_400.png) on CR, why don't i check out Omegle. So i decided to spend half an hour to chat with strangers in Omegle and here's what i got.

[Nexted](http://nexted.urbanup.com/4740492) is a CR term lets call its Omegle counterpart as Deliberately Disconnected or DDed. Within half an hour ive been DDed by about 10 people. I DDed about 3. Two of them who told 35/male/horny and one other guy who typed f u for whatever i typed.  But i  actually spoke for more than 5 mins to two people. One Korean who thinks everyone in India are Rich and a Supposedly 16 year old Brazilian Girl who asks me every 30 seconds, whether i believe that she is a 16 yr old girl. Leaving all that aside lets come to the ppl who DDed me.

1\. The ASL Case . Omegle predominantly consist of people who start with a/s/l and DD you right away.

2\. So i thought not all them can be pervs and some actually will have the patience to talk to other people too. So i tried some a reverse psychology . Which apparently was a big fail.

3\. Initially i thought a/s/l was a single entity which decides your 'seconds till DD' . But i was wrong there too .

4\. Finally there are some girls who want to talk only to pervs. Like this one.

People have been known to spend hours and hours of their time in Stranger chats like these. Stranger chats are so damn addictive . But people, think for a minute. It will strike you. You do have a life. So ending on Major Sundarrajan's notes. This is the week's advice; adhaavathu ithaan indha vaara thathuvam.
