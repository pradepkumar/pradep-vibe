Because there are no recommendations for the movie or 5 star ratings in this post. Not even verdicts or good and bad aspects of the film. It is just my view and my rant of astonishment towards how close can a person bring a movie to the heart of the viewer.

Initially my expectations for the movie were pretty low. I thought i'll go clap when A.R.Rahman's name is being rolled in the credits, Drool at Trisha, comment of Simbhu's overacting and overperforming dance steps and see a highly sophisticated english speaking love story. I was very wrong. I thought the movie was only for high heel wearing,  barista going, dog loving, peter-english speaking girls who say 'Wow' and 'Cute' more than 20 times a day and their _i-drink-only-foreign-sarakku_ boyfriends. I was wrong again.

The movie is not about Trisha, Simbhu, the funny cameraman or even Gautham Menon for that matter. Its bigger than that. The depth of the movie as a whole overshadows every other aspect of it.  One thing evident from the movie is that no mortal can _imagine_ such a script. He need to have been there done that.

I am not going to do the mistake of talking about the songs. It's the most popular thing next to Nithyanandha at present. But the picturisation of the first three songs looked all the same to me. Same steps different locations. No blame to the director as doing anything other than that will spoil the theme of the movie.

Some dialogues in the movie makes you wonder about the romance level of the people who wrote them. Especially

> **Jesse:** Naan unakku avlo azhaga therinjena?
> 
> **Karthik:** Adhellam ippo solla mudiyathu, modhal padam varum, adhula paathu therinjiko.

and

> **Jesse:** Un kan vazhiya avunga yaarum enna paakala polirukku.

Some scenes like the one when Simbhu tells his love to Trisha in the road and the camera starts circling her were too good on screen. One thing which is evident from the movie is that Gautham has a clear cut idea about the choices every girl has in front of her and ultimately what most of them choose in the end. But if you make a movie about the mistake a girl made and show it to the world, it is like stabbing her a thousand times in the heart. I agree with [Kalai](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=709325282&ref=ts) now . Mechanical Engineers are high romance people !

Initially i was pissed off about the title of the being just another title suttufied from a song line. But thinking of it now, there can NOT be any other title which suits the movie well. Fuckin A.

Finally some of the things which my friends told after seeing the movie

> **[Kanna](http://goodbadndugly.blogspot.com/):** Cha. Intha padatha paakamaye irunthirukkalaam polirukku.

> **Kalai:** Machi, friendunga kooda llam padathukku pogatha. Comment adichi uyira eduppanunga. Thaniya poi padatha paaru.

And one of my colleagues in office asked me _"Padam, Love failure aanavungalukkum, Love panranavangalukkum thaan pudikkumaame ? Apdiya ?"_ . Well are there any other kind of people in this world ?
