Coming to US to study is a life changing experience. That too i didn't  feel that Boston is such a party place till my friends from other cities visited and told me so. Boston is a college town and so naturally the average age of people at Boston should be comparatively lower. What this means in Chennai Lingo is that there are One too many _vellakaara_ figures around. Not a day has past by without me seeing some random hot girl as soon as i step out of house. But even with their perfect bodies and skimpy clothes, these girls didnt seem so attractive. Atleast not as attractive as any average looking tamil girl here.

Finding tamil girls here is like finding water in a desert and befriending them is far more difficult as most of them already have a heavy God Complex. But my world was about to change when she came and sat in the chair before me at a presentation.

Initially i didnt know she was tamil. Hell i didnt even look at her while she sat down. But the moment i hear her ask  'Seekaramave Vandhuttiya" i was taken aback. She was talking with a friend in tamil and i couldn't get a good glimpse of her. I was thinking how could i have missed a Tamil girl from my batch as they were only a handful. Then i reeled back in to notice that she actually looked pretty good. Higher than usual height, well preserved long hair and most importanly she was wearing a full formal suit. I could only see 3/4ths of her face but that smile was angelic. I saw her face fully when she turned back to give the sign-in sheet to me. Wheatish brown complexion, Kajal filled eyes, perfect set of teeth she was definitely an 8.

I was very happy as she was the only thing which interested me in that shitty presentation. I was waiting for the presenter to pass some more sheets of paper so that she'll turn and give me and i can look at her eyes once again. Her sitting posture, the way she talked to the girl beside her, everything was so poetic. I was determined to talk with her after the presentation gets over. I was even thinking of Ice breakers. Everything from 'Neenga Tamila' , 'Ivanellam present panlennu yaar azhudha' to 'Adutha maasamllam temperature -15 -20 poidum pola irukke' was running in my mind. And while i was thinking about all these, something happened. She had reached her pocket to get something and something fell out of it. She was turning around looking for it. I was happy that i got to see her again. I looked for the thing which she was searching but i couldnt find it in front of me so i went back concentrating on her. And then my friend sitting next to me seemed to have located it and gave it to her. She turned back with a smile. Eventhough brief, it "lit up" the room.

I murmured into his ears "_Dei enkitta kudithirukkalaamla, naan kuduthiruppene. Cha. Ennathu, Pen a?_ " He replied with a _kevalamaana_ look "_Aaannn. Lighter da_".

It did lit up the room.
