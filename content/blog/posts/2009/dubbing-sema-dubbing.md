Before i start the post, i would like the make the title clear as it may look stupid to most. Dub has multiple meanings . Two of them being

1.Dub - English for 'the process of recording or replacing voices for a motion picture'

2\. Dabbu - Telugu i suppose - Money .

So by now we all have the basic idea that the post is about 'dubbing' minting money . Nice .

English movies dubbed in Tamil have entertained me ever since i saw one particular movie . Kung Fu Hustle (Mirattal Adi) . After that many many movies have came out dubbed in Tamil . Everyone has to thank Vijay TV too , for making Jackie Chan and Samo Hung speak Tamil .

The first and foremost component of a dubbed movie is the name . I really dunno who is the authority in naming these films . But whoever be it , they do a pretty 'good' job . The first thing i wait for when a big English movie releases is to see how it is christened in Tamil . Over the years i have noticed many such funny names . To name a few...

1\. **2012 - Rudhram** . Actually who would translate a movie which is named 2012 . It's a number for God's sake.

**2\. Twilight Saga: The New Moon - Thigilan : Edharkum Thunindhavan .** As i had already tweeted i expected the name of this movie to be _Onaimanithanum Rathakaateriyum_ . But looking at the new name , WOW . Aegan , Ayan nra varisaila oru nalla peru miss aiduche .

**3\. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Paayum Puli Padhungum Naagam .** No blaming here . Dragons aren't Tamil Animals . Do we have a tamil name for Oranges or Apples ?

**4\. D Wars - Rudranaagam**

**5\. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry Potterum Maaya Thee Koppayum**

**6\. Order of the Phoenix - Phoenixin Kattalai** . Remember 'Order' literally translates to _Kattalai_ in Tamil.

**7\. Kung Fu Hustle - Mirattal Adi .** Its such a huge hit here that many of them know the Tamil name only .

**8\. 300 - Munnooru Paruthi Veerargal .** No comments.

**9\. I am Legend - Naran .** Name most probably chosen as _' Naan oru Kaaviyam_' sounds lame and a lot like _' Naan oru Muttalunga' ._

**10\. Shoot 'em Up - American Pokkiri** . Endha alavukku Pokkiri hit aairuntha intha pera choose panni iruppanga . Yosinga Ajith anbargale , Yosinga .

**11\. Ukkiran - Fast and the Furious .** Tamil titlekkum English title kkum edhaavathu oru sambantham irukka ? I think this was also influenced a lot by the ilayathalapathy guest starrer _Sukkiran ._ :D

**12\. Aandhai Manidhan - Chronicles of Riddick**

**Marma Manidhan - V for Vendetta**

**Kallarai Manidhan - Van Helsing**

**Pachai Manidhan - The Incredible Hulk**

I strongly believe that all these names were kept by 5th  Std studying sons of the People in the Translation Committee as no one would have had a clue about the Literal Translation of the Names :D

**13\. Sooravali - Tomb Rider .**

(if !( (Literal\_Translation) || (Derived\_Translations))

then (Keep a Fierce name which indicates the prowess of the hero/heroine)

English movies dubbed in Tamil are always fun . Not only fun , but they fetch big bucks too . 'The Hindu' once had an article stating Van Helsing was flop but not Kallarai Manithan ! . Hell , [Van Helsing's IMDB page](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338526/releaseinfo#akas) has the tamil name along .

Here's one of the top takkar tamil dubbings of all time
