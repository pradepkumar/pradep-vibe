[![Villu ](images/2jffv9k.jpg "Villu ")](http://i42.tinypic.com/2jffv9k.jpg)Villu

You must have figured out by now , Yes this is a review for Villu . For starters i am (was) a vijay fan . I saw the movie First day Evening show in Vettrivel Theatre (a local theatre in our neighborhood) . I really thought seeing Vijay movies on the first day will be great eventhough the story is crappy . Prabhu Deva proved me wrong . Now lets jump into the review.

Before starting i would like to thank Mr.Tony Jaa of Tom Yum Goong fame and the Resident Evil Cast and Crew as Prabhu Deva forgot to mention them . Fight scenes total rip from Goong and one scene IMBA lift from RE . Thats common . Come on who doesnt rip . Billa's climax was from The Recruit . So no problems with that.

**Khusboo:**

Khusboo is worshiped by many people as a goddess . We all know she even has temples on her name . She comes in the intro song of the movie . Total slutty look . I mean the 'Aaru padam Aishwarya' look .  And she has tried to dance the fast steps of vijay in it . Looked very pathetic.

**Vadivelu:**

You all have to accept that vadivelu has a huge fan following that any other actor at present . Me and my friends are crazy fans of Vadivelu . I mean , Who cannot like  '_Rollingla po'_ and ' _Enna Irumura ? Irumula da Urumuren'_ from thalainagaram and all . Prabhu deva have totally wasted him in Villu . All his comedy scenes have no relation with the movie . Its a separate track.  Total Useless . He comes around the screen with the bullshit hair style and its not funny but totally annoying . And many of us have seen the _Matrix Cow_ funny animation video . Totally copied here  . Vadivelu fights the cow :( .

**Nayanthara:**

Its high time kollywood directors start to realize that heroines are human beings and not just meat malls . Minimal Dress . Maximum exposure . All for nothing . She doesnt even have the role of the women in anniyan who puts a case on her house owner "_Mudiyara varaikkum muyarchi pannuvom , illanna vesham kudichi sethudrom"_ Remember ? Damn , she just comes around wearing revealing clothes , dancing for songs . The last 'dimtharikita' song her looks are total total whory . OMG that song came out of the blue . No possible song-generating-scenes there. And dialogues _" Naan 15 vayasilaye aalana ponnu, Ippo 21 vayasaachu"_ . Thevaya. Aaarrrghhh .

**Story:**

Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert.

For god's sakes continue reading . There cant be any more spolier for the movie . It is totally spoilt anyways . Keeping it short .

Goons kill Father- Villian Head Goon- Heroine daughter of Villain- Hero kills 'em all - Wins Heroine's heart. End of Story.

But here comes the inside scoop . Vijay plays Double role . Father and Hero. The difference bet both of em being one comes in a diff mush. And guess what Father Vijay is miltary :-( (Ya comes in Army uniform, Sorry ) and no body has any idea what the hero Vijay is . That makes him a Police hired- Incognito - FBI trained - Local hero looking - Nayan loving - Mercenary . Duh .

**Screenplay:**

Many scenes have no relation with their prev ones . And guess what i forgot to thank James Bond . PD has copied that under water jet ski thing even . And Oh My God if it were a superhero movie please mention it in the subtitle . Like _"There are heroes. There are superheroes. And then there's Hancock" ._ No mentions here but Vijay strolls aroung doing superhero stuff . Sorry PD , nobody's gonna buy it . Even Kids . Blasting off 6 Innovas which are circling him with a single button RDX , and coming out without a scratch . Please no . Sharing screen space with MGR , Anbae Vaa movie scene . No No . Ridiculous . None of the scenes are even close to reality here .

**Climax:**

Father Vijay was stamped with a "Traitor" stamp after his death and so ... Dont lose me .. Listen Up ... Ranjitha ( His wife and Hero Vijay's Mom) is tatooed with a " Desa Drogyin manaivi" tatoo in the forehead . (WTF!!) Our guy  seeks revenge and brings Prakash Ra(Villian) to the same 'ol temple where Ranjitha had left Pugazh(Hero Vijay) some 20 years ago . And Kaboom , Ranjita is still sitting there in that temple . Wow . So Pugazh when about to kill PR asks him a _vaakumoolam_ in front of the public ( Who obviously have no other damn work other than hearing this crap) stating that Major Saravanan(Father) isnt a traitor . He gives it and gets killed . I have to explain this scene though .

Vijay threatens PR by holding a huge metallic cylinder on top him with the help of a crane . He gives his statement under the cylinder amd as Vijay leaves the cylinder , it falls on the screen and it goes black . To my surprise the credits start rolling fading out from that black screen . Naan apdiye Shock aaiten . No proper ending . No  _"Ammaa unga sabathatha naan neraivethitamma"_ crap . And Nayan goes missing after the flashback has been told .

**Verdict:**

It was a like a movie finished in hurry berry . No component is good . Nayan provides good eye candy . But shes doing it a lot lately right ? Theres nothing new . Its a story which would have run if taken in 1995 . Thanks PD for providing valuable material for Lollu Sabha guys .

**P.S:** I have no idea why the movie is named Villu. And The Blue ray disc which comes in the movie is the thing which has all the details of the villian . His network and all . Sounds like Billa ? Dairy-PenDrive-BlueRay. Jayam Ravi pls dont use a microSD card in your next movie . Please .
