I dunno if many of you have come across rasigar manra season's greetings and all .Yes i am referring to the A4 sheets with black and white content stuck on walls and water tanks whenever a movie realeases on a festival day . In our area it is a usual sight . Ajith and Vijay fans are constanly battling it out for power or supremacy over the area . Their only weapons are these handouts which they print for each movie . Okay lets get into the details .

I found this pasted on my house compound wall . I was just about to tear it off . But looking at it i realized that every handout is made in the same way, every year for every movie . So i unstuck it carefully and scanned it . Hope you guys don't mind about the condition of the paper . :-P . I have numbered the characteristics in the image so read it along with the image.

**Top 10 Characteristics:**

1.  Always A4 paper . Why ? Coz that is only cheap and available . No colours , only black and white as it will be easy to take xeroxes or who knows maybe one of the _manra uruppinars_ has a xerox shop .

2\. The whole poster wil be written in THE Movie Font . In this case they have tried a lot to write in Villu style font . I have a question here . I have known abt Vijay Rasigar Manrams and Ajith Rasigar Manrams . What the hell is _Villu Narpani Manram_ ? And what _Narpani_ they do ? Shew ..

3\. A Noob diagramatic representation of the festival they are supposedly wishing . Here we can see a sugarcane that looks like a coconut tree which is the height of the pongal paanai .

4\. Whats a _manram_ without the posts ? So the whole _area pasanga_ names will be printed in the order of 'who-has-bought-beedi-for-the-group-most-number-of-days' . The top guy being Thalaivar . Usually the other posts are decided the day the poster is _written_. And what exactly is the work of _Manra-Kaapalar_ ? To safe guard the manram from dispersing till the next movie comes ? And i think _uruppinar_ will be a list of school boys from 5th to 10th in the area (Top prority to Younger Brothers of Office Bearers)

5\. Remodified Punch Line from the trailer of the movie . Modified to meet the _manram_ needs . _"Villu , engal kuzhu powerfullu"_ .

6\. Self made punch line or something lifted from magazines like Aanantha Vikadan. "_Villu , edhira nillu , unga kooda irukkuthu dhillu_" ( I have no idea what it means or how to punctuate it ) .

7\. This is a sure shot in any poster . Atleast one of the names will be a character played by the hero or the name of some movie by the hero . In this case _Pokkiri Karthik_ ( I have no idea why _kokki kumar_ came here ). In Rajini rasigar manra posters there'll surely be some 10 names like rajini karthik, rajini mohan, baasha bai , arunachalam venkatesh etc..

8\. Group Name . Dont they have to name themselves ? Its never a new innovative name . Atleast b4 they used to have area names like _Adam Boys_ (for Adambakkam) or Royapuram Rockers ( from the cult classic Chennai 600028) . Now look at the name of our group . _Triplex Boys_ . Wow . Guys you are gay . Yuck . Terror Boys , XXX Boys  seriously forget these names .

9\. Group Logo . Its good to see the movie Vin Diesel's XXX logo has made quite an impact worldover . 100s of autos have it . 1000s of bikes . Now time to make an entry into rasigar manram posters .

10\. Stills from the movie. Usually stills released in papers will be used . Now guys take it from internet i guess . Look at the center pic of vijay . His expression is like hes trying to rape the cheetah in the center . _Manra Design Heads_ , ive got a message for you . Find Good Stills .

X. I have no idea what happened in the X marked place.  It says _Mahendran to Mahadevan_ . The guy must have namelogically changed his name .

Thats it . I have enlightened you with valuable _rasigar narpani manra_ gyan . :-P
