Blog, fish tank maari . Food podaama iruntha meenellam sethu poidum . Idhukkagave appappo oru post pottu blog a uyiroda vechirukka vendiyirukku . It's been ages since i blogged. Coz i didnt get any damn topic to talk about. Suddenly oru thought. Kaila vennaya vechittu neikku alairomennu . So indru naam alasappogum topic 'Fighting Boredom' . Or as i say Kolling the time .

Few students from our class have taken the MS route and are waiting to go to the US soon.  Some more guys have already joined jobs mostly in B'lore and Chennai . College la irukkara varaikkum oru message kooda anuppadha Dogellam ' Hi , this is So-n-So , I am leaving to B'Lore for work . This is my new number' nu kaduppadikarthukkaagave oru message anupparaanunga. Adha vidunga. This leaves us with the fair amount of people who are waiting for work to start . The author actually falls/lies/vizhunthu-kedakkarar in this category . This post is aimed at that select population of people .

Namma Vadivel sonna maari Chumma irukkarathu ulagathulaye romba kashtamaana vishayam . But once you face it and live with it you can master it . So here are my 10 steps to Murder Boredom.

10\. Set Top Box: If you don't have any Direct-To-Home connections please get one . Beleive me you cant watch Kolangal and Arase daily . Appadiye Discovery channel oru 'Future Weapons' , AXN la oru 'So you think you can dance' ippadi paathomna arivum valarum , time pass aana maariyum irukkum .

9\. Movie Download: If you are not a big time movie watcher better try to become one . Movies are a big timepass and ya they give you something to 'Peter' about . 'Dei , i saw that Wrestler movie that day. Mickey Rourke Acting chance illa la' - Meaning ' I downloaded and saw the movie Wrestler , What about you ' .

8\. Blog: This is a bit too much , but you can actually blog about some random nonsense and pester your friends to read it . Shoo Shoo shut up guys i dont write nonsense . Hmmm if you are devoid of topics, take the evergreen route 'College Life' is there and then 'The last movie i saw' is there and ya the latest topic 'R.I.P. MJ :( ' is there . So make yourselves comfortable and write something .

7.Useless Mail: You can actually join some no-good yahoo group which sends so called 'funny-pics' to your mailbox . Will serve as a morning warmer . Uh put a filter for the words 'Cute , Cats , Dogs' etc coz most of the time you'll be looking at some chinese baby photos with some newborn kittens . Annoying at many times.

6.Kootu Sadhi: Try to meet up with 'Like' friends who are also vetti . Vetti+Vetti= Great Freaking Timepass . You can talk about absolutely anything from Obama to Vettaikaaran to Megan Fox. Killing time one topic at a time :D

5.Times of India: Please subscribe to TOI or DC . Don't buy hindu for god's sakes . Does Hindu have crucial info like which-actor-is-going-out-with-whom and all that stuff . No . So get one of these two papers and you already would have killed half your time.

4.Games: If you are a fan of computer games then well and good you wouldn't have come to my blog on the first place if not i have an idea . If you have successfully accomplished Step 6: Kootu Sadhi then life becomes easier. Get a pack of cards , one coke 2 liter bottle and some snacks . Sorgam . My personal advice is to get a carrom board . Imba entertainment .

3\. Sleep: Thookatha vida oru sirandha timepass enna irukka mudiyum . Veetla AC iruntha pottittu nimmadhiya thoongunga . Sleeping will increase our working capability aan . Some idiots have told . So sleep well .

2 .Twitter: Twitter sema fun . If your friends are giving useless boring status updates which you dont understand most of the time , dont worry ; follow some famous people at twitter . Take me for example , i follow [@KimKardashian](http://twitter.com/KimKardashian) , [@aplusk](http://twitter.com/aplusk)(Ashton Kutcher) etc . Its great to see what these guys update . I mean ' I am feeling better today' , 'Off to airport' and all that crap . So you can console yourself that more vettier people are there in the planet .

1\. Facebook: People who dont have a FB account close this tab right now . FB is the big daddy of all things which eat time . You can

- Use brilliant , AI mastered applications like ' What color are you' , 'When will you die' , ' What element are you' . Beats the living hell out of you .
- Look at your friends  giving mind boggling updates such as ' I shouldn't have done that . I regret it ' , 'I will not be happy any more, but that doesn’t matter, there are many other things in this world' and such random stupidity.
- Take noob quizzes which even a 7 year old will ace and then publish it with a Happy Smiley as status .
- Play great games like Mafia Wars and say ' I am looking for a Blue Ribbon , I am looking for 5 of Spades ' and whatever you like .

and so on .

So i just gave you a dash of what Step 8 looks like . Experience the others yourselves . Don't thank me yet . Proud to be Vetti .
