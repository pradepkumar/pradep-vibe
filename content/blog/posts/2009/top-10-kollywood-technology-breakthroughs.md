Everybody loves Technology . And with the invent of new technologies, life tends to become a bit more easier . But there's always a strong between Kollywood and Tech Breakthroughs . I've seen many Technologies 'unveiled' in Tamil Movies . In these lines , well see the Top 10 Tech Breakthroughs of Kollywood .

**10. The Point Blank Sniper**\-Modhi Vilayadu

Modhi Vilayadu is a Comedy Circus . So lets concentrate only on our part . A trained Assassin from HongKong is hired to kill Vinay . And guess what , he rides along in a van adjacent to Vinay's car in a attempt kill scene . He sports the usual full black dress with a gulla-face mask . The gun he uses is a high tech Sniper rifle which pans and zooms at the target automatically .  Eventhough the target is a punch away from the barrel , it focuses exactly and the assassin any how misses the shot . Point Blank Sniper is at Number 10.

**9. Finger Pistol** - Newtonin Moonram Vidhi

This is NOT a kollywood breakthrough actually , it was invented by the Director of the Mega Hit Holly movie 'Shoot 'em Up' . Ya , the one with Monica Bellucci :P . In NMV , S.J. Surya has a set of bullets but unfortunately couldn't find a gun . So he keeps each bullet in the gap between his fingers and keeps his hand in fire . The bullets fire like party pops and kills the Villain . Seems Surya don't need guns after all .

**8. The Auto Corrupt Pen Drive** - Billa 2007

Ajith gives a Pen Drive to Rahman at the Climax scene . At first he checks it and it 'Works' fine . 'works' here means there is a extremely complex User Interface design on the Pen Drive which on Plugging autoruns and shows the List of Names of All Felons associated with him . Such a thoughtful backup by 'Jegadish' . And the fun part is that after some time the PC screen starts shaking and a error message is shown saying 'File Corrupted' in Big Red Capital Letters . Apple, are you listening ?

**7. Video Background Analyzer** - Narasimha

The Terrorists send a video to the Police which is shot from a Desert Location . But it is actually not . The T forces shoot the video in a Snowy place and apply their CG expertise in it to change the BG . Vijaykanth on seeing the video , finds out that the BG has been tampered and hits 'Enter' on the Keyboard . Kaboom. The original snowy bg shows up and they zero in the Terrorists hiding place . Highly Advanced Material .

**6. The Parachute Coat** \- Villu

Before going to the Parachute Coat, this whole sequence from Villu is Futuretastic. The Laser Room copied from Resident Evil, the biometric , voice and retina testing machine which projects the message 'Voice code accepted' in mid air and the Pocket Knife which cuts through Industry Grade Aluminum like Processed Cheese , the list goes on . Anyway, when Vijay jumps from the Plane , he doesn't seem to wear a Parachute. But when he tears open his Coat, a fully functional Parachute kicks out and he flies and lands in Nayanthara's lap . Ya , HE WAS WEARING THE CHUTE THE WHOLE TIME ! .

**5.  Do-it-Yourself Phone Explosives** - Madura

The Villain owns a Mobile Network . So what ? He plants explosives in SIM cards . Soon most of the phones in the city have this Remote Controllable Any Time Activation Explosive in them . When Villain threatens to detonate it by Calling A NUMBER , Vijay destroys a nearby telephone tower and thus saving millions of lives . The city is safe , Thanks to Powerpuff Vijay .

**4. Bullet Proof Archana Plates** - Sabari

This Video is probably the most watched Video in YouTube . Vijaykanth has a archana plate under his shirt. The Bad Guy takes out a .38 and takes a clean shot at Captain's Chest area. The bullet cruises towards him , hits the plate takes an inverse swinging parabolic path and hits back the bad guy clean an square . NYPD R&D guys have watched the video zillion times , reports say .

**3. Pyro Tactics** - Sanda

Nadiya and her Daughter arrive in a car . Our hero Sundar C takes a Knife and throws it with deadly precision towards the Fuel tank of the car . The knife clean shaves the Tank cover along with the lid . Then he ignites his cigarette using his BARE HANDS , how cool is it . Then throws the Cig with the same accuracy , it gets into the tank and blows off the damn car . Sundar C scores a 3 pointer .

**2. Powerpoint v.135.9** - Sivaji The Boss

Rajini somehow has a ppt which shows the list of bogus assets of people . And as the slideshow progresses , the ppt pulls info from complex servers across the country and finally shows what ? THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BLACKMONEY IN INDIA . Tax Officials , don't you worry . The file will be mailed to you soon .

**1. Age Miracle** - Singaravelan .

This is probably why i thought of writing this post itself.  In Singaravelan , Kamal has a photo of Khusboo shot at the Age of 5 . He wants to know how she looks like after 18 years . So they go to a place called ' Computer Point'. The gentle man there scans the photo and does some Coding which makes it possible to create a image of her as she grows year by year . Wait up , after reaching a 'considerable' age they decide to cloth her up . And we see the lovely Khusboo dancing around wearing a pink dress in AVM sets filled with dry ice smoke. This by far is the most advanced piece of engineering i've ever come across in Kollywood .

I may have left out certain other far more advanced feats . Just let me know . Hail Kollywood .
