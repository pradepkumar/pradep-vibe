That's all for now . Give me suggestions and new award categories . I'll surely put it up and give credit to those who came up with it . And if anybody feel offended and want to reject their awards , Feel free to email me with a 500 word essay on where i went wrong . I'll let my blind PA read it .  I am out of here .

P.S : Some awards may sound strange and non understandable for some people . Read my previous posts on IV(If you haven't already) to get a clear picture . And shhh ... please don't spread the word , i hate publicity :P .
