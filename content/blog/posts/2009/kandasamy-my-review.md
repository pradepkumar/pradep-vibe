Saw Kandasamy Yest Evening show at Albert Theatre . The show started only at 7.30 . I liked the movie overall, but none of my friends liked it . Vikram's officer-look in the movie is definitely a great plus for the movie . Susi Ganesan has tried a 'Shankar' though i should say . Camera Work in the Movie is Extraordinary . Better than most Hollywood movies i've seen recently . I've always thought that the only thing which differentiates Tamil Movies from Hollywood is that our  directors are bound to take films with a standard template format .  Love Sequences , Songs , Item numbers . If you cut off all unwanted songs and masala sequences from Kandasamy, i am sure it'll be a top class movie .

| **Vikram** . His mannerisms, walk, Voice  every thing is a plus. | **Shriya**’s Skin Show, Suchi’s voice didn’t match well at all . She has modified her walk and look . But could have been better. |
| **Camera** . Some shots in the boat club were a real treat to eyes . | **Special Effects** . They have worked too much on effects . Songs looked like Advertisements . |
| **Art** by Thottatharani . Sets were great . ‘Meow Meow’ song setup was fantastic . | **BGM** was a bit off track . Devi Sri Prasad must have paid a little more attention to BGM . |
| **Vadivelu**’s Comedy was as usual historic . Laughed our ass out at the theatre . | **Prabhu** must have been put to a better use. |
| **Screen Play** was very fast and energetic. | **Fight sequences** even though good, were a bit lengthy . |
| **Mexico** part was very well filmed |  |
| **Director** had tried to tie every possible loose ends in the movie . Explain every single detail which most superhero movies won’t bother to explain |  |

Everyone say it is a mixture of many movies . If you count Prabhu as Police and the hero running around in Expensive Armani Suits and wearing everybrand of Sunglasses present in the market and driving a dozen cars each of different 'business-quizzer-know-how' brand, it does look like Billa . If you see it as lots of people working together as a clandestine team for a cause it does look like Ramana . Else if you see it as Hero battling out black money , it maybe like Sivaji The Boss.  No , i didnt count 'Yaavarum Nalam' as Vikram comes out with a hammer and all . Don't be ridiculous . Whatever it may, Kandasamy is a whole new movie with a class of its own . Worth seeing atleast once. I would give it 3 and half stars .
