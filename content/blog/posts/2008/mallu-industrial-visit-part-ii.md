Long time since part one came eh ? All credits to the [Kurukshetra WebSite](http://www.kurukshetra.org.in "K!") which was keeping me occupied all these days (and days to come :(( ) Okay . We left off at the Munnar Experience right . Time for Cochin 'Industries' now . And a small request . If you havent read Part I yet please read it first else all these things will be a bit vague (Konjam Scene a poduvom !) . Alright . Lets Jump in.

All work and no play makes jack a dull boy (Makes jack a millionaire will also suit ) .Never mind. So seeing all those industries and taking down bloody notes and photographs of machines there made us a little dizzy . So we have to do something entertaining right ? That was the bus trip from Munnar to Cochin . It was characterized by people sleeping-sleeping-and sleeping. Dammit it was so boring until someone planned to play an [anthakshari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthakshari "Anthakshari") . This gentlemen, is one of the few things i enjoyed in IV . As usual we were split up into two teams and Vigirthan Fernando(:-)) was 'requested' to start it . Our team had some good players like Myself (Quiet Please ), Venkat, Rohit ( :-P ) , Nitin ( :-P ) and all . And their team had Aishwarya . Database this one . Anthakshari went on for a while . Then came Dumb-C . And guess what we had even English Movies for the sake of people who-pretend-to-not-know tamil (Enki Tamil Konjum Konjum Varum guys) . Dumb C was high octane action with swears-of-joy like F\*\*\* U going in the air . Enough of this . Too much Description for a bus trip .

_**Someday before IV , TQM class:-**_

Me: Dei namma cochinla enga thanga porom ?

Bun: Star Hotel da . 3 Star i think . Wait ill get the brochure from Nitin and show.

Me: Dei hotel peru "Hotel 3 Star" a ? Illa unmayave 3 star hotela ?

Bun: See this .

Me: Dei looks gr8 da . Has swimming pool and all . Rooms look good .

Bun: Summava Pinna .

_**Present Day: Bus Stops at a [Guatanamo Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay_detention_camp "G Bay") Look alike place**_

Mini Vans picked us up from the spot the bus left us , as it is a pucca residential area and the hotel was built inside a 'muttu chandhu' . I have a serious doubt whether those drivers were driving autos back in anna salai . The kind of skill and elegance behind the wheel , i've seen only in NFS intro videos . Same drill at the hotel lobby . Rooms of four ppl each and as usual Madhan Raj was roaming around with a good-for-nothing list 'trying' to allocate rooms to ppl .

Group 1: Dei neenga 4 perum 5th floor la irukkara room 510 kku shift aikkareengala ?

Group 2 : Why da ? Whats the problem here ?

Group 1: Illa da naanga 8 peru onna irukkanumnu . Athan . So please .

Group 2: (Onnava ? ) Seri enna ezhavo . Polam .

Onnum Purila la ? Okay well go mathematically . Revealing 2 unknowns here will definitely help to find the third one . The room this conversation happenned was [Room 609](http://thevc.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/in-gods-own-country/#comment-724 "LoL"). And Group 2 consists of Me, VC, Sivaguru and SIvagami . Purinja Seri. Ulaga Thathuvatha idhoda simple a yavanaalayum solla mudiyathu . What happened in 609 after that ? Who were the mysterious 8 ? Why did they make us shift ? One answer . _History_ .

Eesani moolaila oru coat stand . Granite meda vecha kitchen. Glass top Dining Table . Chandramuki Bunglow Sofa Set . Uppu-Melagu vekkarthukku shelf . Awardellam vekkarthukku TV Stand Showcase . Ithellam antha roomku thevaya ? Mavane bedla 2 per thaan padukka mudiyum . Ethu thevayo athu mattum andha hotella illa. Matha ella kupayum irunthuthu . "Pool Closed for Private Party" apdinra board naanga anga thangina moonu naalum andha swimming pool la potirunthuthu . Enakku therinju Entha Kombanum 3 days party lam vekka maatan . "_Neenga kudutha kaasukku swimming poola kannala paathukkonga_" apadinra board a than avan vekka try pannan nu naan nenaikkaren. Okay . Industry Time .

**6\.** **'Ilichavaays Welcome' Boating Corp. a.k.a 'Back'Water Boating .**

Back Water na apdiye country Side la irukkum . "_kadalinakkare ponore, kaana ponninu ponore, poy varumbol enthu kondu varum -- kai niraye poy varumbol enthu kondu varum_" style la irukkum nellam nambinen . Oru ezhavum illa .  75 Rupees per head . And we sat on plastic chairs on a piece-of-junk which sivagami correctly commented as "Dei antha pepsi PET bottle laam kudichittu thooki podromla , athelllam sethu vechi katti , boatunnu solli vittudraanunga da"  . Kittathatta antha conditionla thaan antha boat irunthuthu . Theres nothing much to mention abt the boat except Nitin . He was restless . Shoot-at-Sight maari yaarellam paakaraano avangalellam ottittu irunthaan . Then we tried playing anthakshari for some time (approx 4 hours) . Came back alive by god's grace.

**7\. Malabar 'Kuchi' Factory:**

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="256" caption="Malabar 'Kuchi' Factory"\]****[![K](images/w1w7x2.jpg "Beach")](http://i36.tinypic.com/w1w7x2.jpg)****\[/caption\]

Beach it was after the terrific boat ride . After seeing that beach , my respect level towards marina had gone way too high . Romba chinna beach . Too much crowd . Many fellows decided to stay dry (shame) . But naanga konjam peru thannila overa aattam potuttu irunthom .  And our topic-hero 'kuchi' a.k.a Srivatsan was one among us . Thideernu etho kaalla kutthi , ore ratham . So we carried him to the shore .. I have to say at this point that Tamizhargal and Keralites have a lot in common . Solren . Some 4 of us were standing around him as the crowd grew. 10s , 100s maybe . Ellarum vanthu kuchi yoda lesa keerna kaala paathuttu irunthaaanga, etho Antartica la irunthu kalla thoni eri penquin vanthu kara othunguna maari . Crowd Puller Kuchi . One more noteworthy thing abt that beach was Kites . Bun, Rohith, Nitin, Aish, Vandhana and all were so involved in flying a kite . And Rohith was doing the honorable job of Cutting Competitor Kite Threads by hand .  :-P .

**8\. Holiday Security Systems**

Next day we were very happy as it was supposed to be Veega Land day . We went to Veega Land only to find that it was too crowded as it was a Holiday (Oct 2). So what ? Kootam irukka thaan seiyum . Poi thaan Paakalam nu nenaikkum bothu than vechaanga oru checku . "Intha maari kootam irukkum bothu nammala girsukku security thara mudiyathu" "Girls feel it is too unsafe" nu etho manirathnam padathula vara chitappa character maari serious ana pechugal . So pack up . Flaw in the Plan .

**9\. Disco Boat Manufacturers:**

Emaatrathudan thirumbina engala "Disco Boat" vaa vaa endru azhaithathu . We went from veegland to a supposedly disco boat which had no disco lights on the first place . Whenever a patrol boat comes the sounds will be off . Pathetic boat . I mean , have you seen a boat with rear view mirrors ? Book a day with this 'industry' . Highlight of the boat was Nari's dance . Intha '_kuttichatthan_' padathullem oru chinna white bommaya vechi mandaram pannuvaanga theriyumla  ? Athaan antha bomma kaiya aatna namma hero kai aadum , bomma nenjula hair pin a vechi kuthuna hero ratham kakki saavaare , athe bomma than . Antha maari nari a aada vechu ellarum sirichuttu irunthaanga . But beleive me , Nari came out with some groovy dance moves :-P .

After the boat ride , we were left uncaged to do shopping . Nendaranga chips , Chakka Chips ippadi variety variety a pasanga porutkala vaangittu irunthanga :-P . Ezhavu enga veetu sandhula irukkara 'New Chennai Chips' la thinam thinam 6 manikku sooda itha podrane , ithavera vaangi vechuttu alayanumannu athellam naan vaangave illa . Jegan . I havent talked abt him till now right ? Okay Jegan went berserk in the IV taking random snaps of everything . And take a look at the following two .

It was Vijay's birthday the next day . So there wa s a 'birthday party' planned on that night . Actually they were celebrating 3 birthdays . VC , Jeffy, Nitin . And i have to say the last one on the list was the most to enjoy . Intha Arjun padathulallam suitcase mela shaving cream , towellam vechittu , adila vairam kadathi customsa emathuvaanga paarunga , antha maari 'Birthday Party' nnu oru pera vechittu ulla ennanna _gilugiluppugal_ . _Sarakku_ mattum thaan missing . Athu mattum irunthirunthunna magane 'Park Hotel' la new year kku 'dance' aadi maatna jodigal maari anga pala jodigal maatti irukkum . Intha Vekka padra maari nadikkarthu irukke , unmayave athu romba kashtamana vishayam . Namma class ponnunga ennama antha 'art' a develop panni vechirukkanga . Venda viruppa dance aadra maari nadippu . Sila Makkal Vijay Birthday annikku vandhadhukku Vijay Ammavukku manasaala thanks solli irunthiruppanganrathula entha sandhegamum illa . Hmmm sila per 'dilamo dailamo' nnu suthittu irundhappo , pala peru 'raasathi unna kaanadha nenju , kaathadi pol aaduthu' nnu oru orathula ukkandhuttu irunthanga . Naan thaan modhal seattu .

**11\. Veegaland Amusement and Araajagam Corporation :**

Next Day Veegaland . After sorting out all the security issues , we finally set foot into Veegaland . Heard of 'Man to Man marking' right ? 'Man to Women' marking was a new feature unvieled at Veega . I heard it . Couldn't see what that was anyway . Purinjavungalukku Seri . Wave Pool was one thing i loved in Veega . Andha wave varumbothu vara BG music irukke . Adadada . Toppu . Me, Thanu, VC, Venkat llam wave varumbothu poi antha far end rope a thottuttu vandhom :-P . Sema jolly a irunthuthu . And after wavepool we were wandering around the whole park going to some random rides .  Funny part abt Veega was we never met any of our coll guy/gal in any ride . Apdi enga thaan poi tholanjaangalonnu nenachikittu iruntha nerathula thaan pala pala unmaigal therinjithu . Pala blog gal la pala unmaigal velippadum polirukke .  'Aandavare thaan seivathu ariyamal seidhu konduirukkum moodargalai mannithu arulumappa ' .

Ellathayum mudichikittu , moota kattikittu oorukku pora trainla erinom nightu . Rajesh was trying to make some space for us to sit and speak , as all lower berths were given to other outside ppl . While talking with one such fellow .

Raj: Sir , neenga seat no. 27 kku shift aaikka mudiyuma ? Naanga inga ukkanthuttu pesittu iruntha ungalukku disturbance a irukkum , athaan .

Fellow: (Grunts)

Raj: Sir , u know English ? We want to ... Want to... (Intha naay avar kitta poi english theriyumannu kekkuthu )

Fellow : Naan venumna upper berth la paduthukkaren pa . Enakku entha problemmum illa .

Raj : ok sir

Eppadillam Asinga pattalum , manam thalaraama oru seat fulla vaangi kuduthan rajesh . Paravalla .

Inthaanga , naanga kerala poi thirumbi pala anubavangaloda vandha kadha . Ellarukkum pidichirukkumnu nambaren . And if i had hurt somebody in the post , please convince yourself that it is for the 'Greater Good ' , coz i didnt do it accidentally i did it on _purpose_ . I am planning on a mini post on certain left out things of the two parts . Hope it comes out soon .
