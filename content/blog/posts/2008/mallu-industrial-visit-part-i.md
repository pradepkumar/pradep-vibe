Industrial Visit . This is the name which is used by Engineering college students across the city to represent 'College Tour' . But we CEGians are different . I mean we have to be different . Different in the sense we go on a tour ONLY to visit industries, unlike others who just go taste _sarakku_ . Okay all these are in accordance with the Industrial Visit(will be referred as 'IV' henceforth) which we CSE guys went last week . And what other place to go other than Kerala ? God's Own Country . Ennavo kadvul anga vanthu karayorama ara ground nelam vaangi vecha maari solraanunga . Anyways IV was scheduled to 'happen' at Munnar and Cochin . Both of them are highly 'industrious' cities . We visited more industries than we can remember . I'll to bring out the maximum . This IV was not a normal one . Had many discrepancies .

Neraya per naan varla - nee varlannu kazhandikkanunga . Hmmm . Avangalukku therila indha industry ellam paathu vara knowledge vera engayum kedaikkathunnu . Poor fellas . Anyways . Namma matterukku varuvom . The Start of IV itself was great . I mean we were supposed to get off the trainby 2 am in Ernakulam. Then we went to Munnar by Bus which was booked previously . Enough stories , well get into serious Industry Business.

First Day was fully Munnar Sight Seeing . We covered two industries .

**1\. 4 goats & Lots of Grass Inc.**

This was a flourishing industry in that area. Sema Crowd. It was 'built' on top of a hill. We had to pay an entry fee of Rs. 25 to see 4 goats and walk uphill for about a mile . Ya i almost forgot about the special extra charge which Thanu paid for his camera . Very informative . This Industry answered many of the questions which were puzzling us right from childhood viz. _What goats eat for breakfast ?_ _How do goats look like ?_ and such High IQ things . To cap it off we drank a Pineapple Juice there which was prepared using just the crushing action of Human Hands . No juicers , No filters . The worst which can ever be made .

**2\. Just-Another-Stupid-Dam(n) Industry.**

The Bus stopped somewhere and i really thought it was a breakdown. I was wrong . There lied an industry which was feared to be the greatest in Munnar . It was a Dam . Water-Stupid Photos-Trying to see girls inside approaching cars-Walk our leg off to a 'Viewpoint'-Elachi Tea 8 Rupeees-Back to Bus . It was very interesting as you can see . We had the times of our lives.

**3\. Garden-of-Laden CampFire Goods.**

People say Ooty Botanical garden is the best in India . Atleast South India . They are soo wrong . This modern Munnar garden-like place was featured on the "_1000 places you should aviod seeing in your lifetime_" survey . Ya, there were 12 varieties of grass and supposed-to-be fountain . And wild flowers which grow on their own alongside NH 47 . Place to be noted down by botanists .

Next Bill , Camp Fire. 25 Rupees each. I mean it was worthy . 25 x 66 = 1650 Rupees . Come on guys One litre Kerosene+5 and half wooden sticks+Cheetah Match Box+ Bose BL2067 Speaker Systems what do you guys expect huh ? 25 was very cheap actually . Could have easily costed the park more than 5000 rupees . People were dancing around the fire . Some on their own . Some induced by Romanovs . And i fell into the category of some who were trying to dance. Actually enjoyed it (Real this time. No sarcasm) . Besides dancing, seeing pros dance was a real sight . I mean Gokul was at his best . Nitin-Samaya moves were beyond Godlike .Â  Bottomline Fun .

Day 2 Started with an Aappam in Hotel Mezban for me, Sivagami and Jegan.

**4\. Thirunelveli Speed Boats & Co.**

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="256" caption="Thirunelveli Speed Boats & Co."\][![Thirunelveli Speed Boats & Co.](images/9j23hl.jpg "Caught in the Act")](http://i36.tinypic.com/9j23hl.jpg)\[/caption\]

If Campfire was the fun moment of day one , it has to be Speed Boat for day two . Coz Speed Boating was the only thing we did on day two . 300 bucks for 5 . Reasonable . Worthy . We got a driver who is supposed to be the Speed-Junkie there . Thirunelveli aalu . Boat a enna valai valachaaru . Really enjoyed it . Oru kaila boat a ottittu innoru kalia camera vaangi photo vera eduthaaru . When asked to overtake the girls boat which went in front of us he said , _"Ada viduppa, potta pullainga "_ . Chance illa .

**5\. 'Kaalamellam Nari Vazhga' Sound Services**.

\[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="256" caption="'Kaalamellam Nari Vazhga' Sound Services"\][![ss](images/264kv1i.jpg "Echo Point")](http://i36.tinypic.com/264kv1i.jpg)\[/caption\]

Next Stop. Echo Point. We tried shouting out names and made all sorts of funny noises . And i have to admit some sounds really echoed :-P . Anyways echo point wasnt really all about echoing . They had pedal boats. I repeat , pedal boats . Pedal Boats which looked rusted due to very less usage . No body seemed to go out boating . Then one pair bravely took the challenge . It was Shanketh and Logesh . Then many ppl seemed to start taking out boats like Samaya-Revathi etc. But the one boat that made all difference was Nari-\[ \]-\[ \] . It started ripples not only in water but also inside many guys who were simply sitting and eating roasted cashewnuts till then. Nitin-Rohith went after them on a hot pursuit. Seriously if Men's Pedal Boating were an olympic event like Double Sculls Nitin-Rohit would have already wore their Gold medals to college. Nari raised a fair income to the troubled boat owners association that day.

We were supposed to stay in Munnar that night and leave for cochin the next day . But the place where we stayed (Munnar Tourist Home) tried to move us out by force. So we set off to cochin after lunch that day.

And dont you see the post is fairly big now itself . So ill write the cochin experience on the next post.
