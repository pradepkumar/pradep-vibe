> \*Okay this question's getting asked a lot so just to be clear: I play the Joker, and I play Batman. Same guy. I did everything except punch myself in the face, which came compliments of my friend Robert (I think you can see how much he enjoyed it). Thank you all for watching.

1:30 and 1:45 were top class ...

Not to mention 2:31 was pure class of genius .. Aaah ROFLMAO ..
