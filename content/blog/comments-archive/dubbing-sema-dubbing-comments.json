I am a bit shy so I will not talk much about myself but maybe when I will get more confortable, you will get to know me better! My main hobbies are playing chess and watching movies. I also love outdoor activites but the temperature has been terrible for the last days or so here in Stirling. I was wondering if anyone else here is from the united Kingdom too? I am glad to have joined this forum! Have a nice day! :) William PS: Sorry if this was posted in the wrong section. I could not find the right one!",
