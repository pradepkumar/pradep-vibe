Bindra Gold wasnt much of an achievement , Just too much Banda, and soon he\u0027ll be another Rathore \u003e:) . Hope Vijender Kumar does it for India, Even if he doesnt end up with a medal He totally deserves some Recognition and Praise \u0026 Should put F\\*ing Bindra in the Shadows.",

US got its freedom in 1776 India got freedom in 1947 so the gap is 171 years... so by now,india should be like how US was in 1837...but we are now like US,as it was in 2006 or atleast our gap is just 2-3 years...so is this not speed?is this not development? To say,India is poor country with lots of riches and so is all the capitalist countries in the world... Will you allow your child or brother or sister or friend to discontinue his studies and do full fledged sports practise? No.You will say those who fail in exams as not fit for anything and tell him to get job as soon as possible,but you would blame india for not getting gold medals.. you will not finance sports people but will blame india for not funding? I want to ask something...Who makes India? It is none other than you and me...we as a whole is india..but we try to escape by putting blame on politicians and go on earning money... if you have urge to earn money and not to help others(not family or friends),so is politician who is also human being...if you try to act socially..i mean clean your street,remove stones from road,..these may look like small acts but will save lives ... but you simple blame politician..so the mistake is with us not with government... :( And \u0027YOU\u0027 refers not to you friends but to those who always blame and degrade india and indians sorry pradep,but i cant control my emotions reading comments on this page :(",
