Shriya Saran been chucked out of the movie storyline and all those songs (more than an hour of them, i presume) removed except for one the Cheyaan with deliver boys sing-song.. this movie could have been improvised to an extent never seen before in Tamil cinema.. off course the cinematography is highly commendable.. but why all this masala..to put in a rightful social message??? I seriously feel it\u0027s high time Tamil Cinema shud get over this masala cacoethes, and focus on improving all aspects of the film,.. the mos important of which, i have found to be the script and editing.. i know for a fact that most of the talkies in town are overbooked, but isnt this torture for the tamil \u0027makkal\u0027 especially shriya in all those horrendous, loathful song sequences and attire. I had Vikram in high regard, even before Anniyan.. and cant really comprehend at least, why he couldnt put an end to the masala overdose and stick to the core point of the film.. Tamil makkal.. get over this masala-lusting nature and ask for what is more reasonably visually appealing for your 2-3 hrs of dat money.",

It is like they shot the important and thought provoking shots of the movie first , then shot useless Shriya shots and added them on to it like tomato sauce on sandwich . Hmmm masala is something which tamil industry thrives on . So these movies will look shitty unless that concept is broken . Movies like Kuruthi Punal must rise again . Think what would have happened if Kamal and Gautami had danced for a Duet song shot in the Alps for kuruthipunal . Thats what has happened in Kandasamy . This must be a lesson for all these Concept Directors . Nevertheless seeing the original aspect of the movie , it was a good effort .",
